<h1>The Best movies according to AllenG.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies - and its tough to limit it to three!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings - the trilogy</h3>
<p>A movie which was very well done and improves on the story from the book - in my opinion.
   The actors were chosen very well and I watch the trilogy every
   year during the Christmas break.  I learn something new every year.  I continue watching the movie each year
   because I need to year reset with good overcoming evil.

<h3>A Christmas Carol with Patrick Stewart</h3>
<p>My Christmas go to movie.  It has always struck me that the story
   of Ebenezer Scrooge left most of society viewing him as the worst person
   in the world.  If you are cranky or not in the Christmas spirit, you're called Scrooge.
   Yet in watching the movie each year, I am reminded that he started off cranky and 
   in a bad mood all the time about life.  But he ended the story a rebuilt person that was
   full of love and care for mankind.  So call me Scrooge and I'll say thank you!

<h3>Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder</h3>

<p>
This movie represents a person who was having a hard time in life.  He persevered and the last line of the movie sums it up.  Do you know happened to
the person who suddenly got everything he ever wanted?  He lived happily ever after.
